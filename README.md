# 🚀 GifsApp

The web application uses Angular 🅰️ and the Giphy REST API 🌐 to function as a GIF and video search tool (https://developers.giphy.com/). Users enter their search query 🔍, and the application displays related results. GIFs and videos are presented as thumbnails 🖼️ and can be viewed in full size or played ▶️. Users can also share the results on social media 📲.
